# Final Steps

## 6. Edit Motive Live Settings
1. Since you will need a license for Motive and the OptiTrack system, ensure you have a PC with Motive installed. Make sure there is one LAN port available to connect your PC later. Open the Motive application.
2. Place reflective markers within the cameras' field of view and return to the PC. Click on **"eSync 2"** in the **"Devices"** section on the top right. Select **"Internal Free Run"** from the **"Source"** options in the **"Sync Input Settings"** section. Check if the markers are visible in the camera view at the bottom middle of the screen.
3. Remove all markers from the cameras' sight and mask any other visible detected objects to avoid interference during **"Wanding"**. Calibrate the system using the **"Wand"** and ensure you cover as much of each camera's field of view as possible. Place the **"Calibration Square"** in the middle of the room and select it to set the ground plane correctly.
4. Open the **"Settings"** menu and switch to the **"Streaming"** tab. Ensure the following settings are configured to stream data correctly to Unreal Engine:
   - **Local Interface**: `10.21.3.162`
   - **Transmission Type**: Unicast
   - **Skeleton Coordinates**: Local
   - **Bone Naming Convention**: UnrealEngine
   - **Up-Axis**: Y-Axis

![requiredItems](https://github.com/luca-g97/SpatialComputing/blob/main/Assets/Setup.jpg)

#### IMPORTANT: Remember or write down the internal IP address (`10.21.3.162`). You will need it to add the correct Live Link Source in Unreal Engine.

## 7. Add Live Link Source
1. Open the Live Link window by navigating to **Window > Live Link**.
2. Add a new source and uncheck **"Automatic"**.
3. Open a command prompt and enter `ipconfig` to retrieve your local IP address (typically starting with `10.x.x.x`). Enter this as the local address.
4. Enter the IP address (`10.21.3.162`) from Motive as the **Source Address**.
5. Finally, create the **"Live Link Source"**, select it, and deactivate **"Animate Y Forward"** in the details section.

## 8. Retarget Skeleton
1. Import the created MetaHuman into your Unreal Engine project via drag and drop.
2. **Animation Blueprint (AnimBP)**: Create a new AnimBP using the skeleton of your MetaHuman. Select **"Live Link Pose"** for the input pose and retarget the asset in OptiTrack. Use the correct Live Link name (the name of your object in Motive) to synchronize the animation correctly.
3. **Settings in the MetaHumanBP**: Ensure that **"LODSync"** is set to `>= 1` and select the created AnimBP for the skeletal mesh. Also, ensure the skeletal animation component is linked to Live Link.

## 9. Synchronize MetaHuman with Yourself
Put on the motion-tracking suit and open the **"Builder"** tool in the Motive application. Pick one of the skeletons (we used **Baseline (41)**) and place the markers as shown. Create a new object and name it as you like. Ensure the correct Live Link name is set in the AnimationBP of your MetaHuman.
